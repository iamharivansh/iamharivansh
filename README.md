I’m currently working on full-stack .NET and Java-based applications while mastering Java, with a strong focus on database-driven systems and real-world projects like food ordering and employee management systems. I’m looking to collaborate on web applications, .NET projects, Java backend systems, and SQL Server or Oracle–based solutions. I’m looking for help with advanced backend architecture, performance optimization, and scalable application design. My expertise includes Java, C#, ASP.NET, SQL/PLSQL, ADO.NET, Windows Forms, and full-stack web development. Fun fact: I enjoy building practical applications that solve real business problems, especially dashboards and reporting systems.
